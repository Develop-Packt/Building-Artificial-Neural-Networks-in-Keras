## Building Artificial Neural Networks in Keras
This module is part of the Deep Learning with Keras learning path â€“ complete this path to learn how to apply deep learning algorithms in Python's Keras library. Review the mathematics that comprise Artificial Neural Networks, apply linear transformations in Python, and build a logistic regression model with Keras.
